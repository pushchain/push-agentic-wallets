/**
 * @title  IPRC20Source — pinned against a LIVE PRC20 on Push Chain Donut.
 *
 * @notice URP's universal init reads exactly one view from the asset,
 *         `SOURCE_CHAIN_NAMESPACE()`, and refuses the grant unless it matches the chain the policy
 *         envelope declares. Every unit test for that path uses a mock, and a mock only ever proves
 *         that URP compares two strings correctly — it cannot prove the interface is the one the
 *         real token implements.
 *
 *         THIS IS THE ONLY TEST THAT PROVES THE MIRROR IS REAL. push-chain-core is not a submodule
 *         of this repository, so there is nothing for the compiler to check `IPRC20Source` against;
 *         the mirror is a hand-copied signature, and a hand-copied signature stays correct only
 *         until the thing it copies moves. The field has been renamed once already
 *         (`SOURCE_CHAIN_ID`, now deprecated), which is the argument for this test rather than
 *         against the coupling.
 *
 * @dev    ⚠️ ENV-GATED, AND A SKIPPED TEST IS NOT A PASSING TEST. Gated on `PUSH_TESTNET_RPC`, the
 *         SAME variable P-03 already uses — deliberately not a third RPC name. Run it against a real
 *         endpoint at least once before reporting this phase done.
 *
 * @dev    NO MOCK APPEARS IN THIS FILE, by design. The whole point is the absence of one.
