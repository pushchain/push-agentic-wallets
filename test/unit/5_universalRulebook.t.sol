/**
 * @notice URP acceptance suite — U-01 … U-22 (U-19 deferred to Phase 3b: it needs removeSession
 *         on a real wallet).
 *
 * @dev    HOW URP IS DRIVEN HERE. The engine does not call it yet, so the harness sets
 *         SESSION_ENGINE to address(engine) and drives both engine-facing entry points with
 *         `vm.prank(address(engine))`. The engine is NOT mocked — we simply call from its address,
 *         which is what the multiplexer key means.
 *
 * @dev    EXACTLY TWO selector-less `vm.expectRevert()` calls exist in this file, and both are
 *         un-named decode residuals that cannot be given an error without introducing an external
 *         call:
 *           1. gate 4 case (d) — a correct-length, structurally-malformed outbound body;
 *           2. gate 12 — a multicall body that is empty or structurally malformed.
 *         Every other negative test names its expected error.

     * @dev DECISION 47 — pre-upgrade universal mandates keep working with NO migration.
     *
     *      This is the property the whole append-only storage design exists to deliver, and it is
     *      the one that would fail silently if the layout had been reordered. A config written
     *      BEFORE native mode existed has an EMPTY `_mode` slot; `checkAction`'s routing sends an
     *      empty slot to `_checkUniversal`, which is exactly right.
     *
     *      SIMULATING A PRE-UPGRADE CONFIG HONESTLY. The current code writes `_mode` on every init,
     *      so a config created here is NOT pre-upgrade-shaped. The distinguishing feature of a real
     *      one is precisely that `_mode` was never written — the slot did not exist when the config
     *      was created. So the mode slot is zeroed with `vm.store` after init, reproducing the exact
     *      storage state the deployed contract holds today: `_configs` populated, `_mode` empty.
     *
     *      That is a state manipulation, not a mock: nothing supplies behaviour to the code under
     *      test. It only removes a write that the pre-upgrade implementation never made.
     *
     *      ⚠️ AMENDED 2026-09-09 (Phase 3b, review §2.1/§4.1). This test previously asserted that
     *      `getMode` REPORTS a legacy config as uninitialised. That was the symptom of a real bug
     *      dressed as a property: because the re-init guard read the same empty slot, a pre-upgrade
     *      config was RE-INITIALISABLE — its `spent` could be reset to zero, or its mode flipped to
     *      NATIVE, through the owner door. `_modeOf` is now legacy-aware, so the truthful statement
     *      is TWO separate facts, asserted separately:
     *        1. the RAW SLOT is still empty — nothing moved, which is the storage claim;
     *        2. the DERIVED view reports `(true, UNIVERSAL)` — which is what the config actually is.

     *      agent door cannot target the engine — so it was owner self-harm rather than an agent
     *      escalation. It is fixed anyway: it silently removed a documented invariant from exactly
     *      the state an upgrade must not weaken.

     * §6.4's retryability guarantee, asserted at the level it is actually observable.
     *
     * HONEST SCOPE — read before "strengthening" this. The PRD motivates step 2's ordering by a
     * misrouted call "burning the outboundTxId while crediting nothing". In the shipped code that
     * failure mode is unreachable by construction: every path that skips the credit also REVERTS,
     * so the `_credited` write is unwound with the frame either way. Verified by mutation — moving
     * the idempotency write above the config check leaves all 64 tests green, because the two
     * orderings are externally indistinguishable in a single transaction.
     *
     * So this test does NOT prove the ordering; nothing at this level can, and a test asserting
     * otherwise would be a test that cannot fail. What it proves is the guarantee Push core is
     * actually promised in §7: a credit that arrives early or against the wrong mandate reverts
     * NotInitialized, leaves the id uncredited, and the retry then succeeds.
     *
     * The ordering remains as written because it is the correct source-level expression of that
     * guarantee and it stays correct if a future edit makes a non-reverting skip path reachable.
